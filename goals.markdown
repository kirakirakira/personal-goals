Personal Goals
==============

Personal goals made open source. (Forked from Una's personal goals starter: http://una.github.io/personal-goals-guide)

Why? I realized what I have been doing and want to do is all over the place. I need to focuse more in order to learn more efficiently and effectively.

# Overarching Goals

2. Earn the Free Code Camp Front-End Development Certificate before the end of 2015
3. Use Github more
4. Get better at communicating
5. Learn about software (oops-- too generic!)
6. Be kind
